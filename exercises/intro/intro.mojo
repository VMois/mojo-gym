# About this `I AM NOT DONE` thing:
# We sometimes encourage you to keep trying things on a given exercise, even
# after you already figured it out. If you got everything working and feel
# ready for the next exercise, remove the `I AM NOT DONE` comment below.

# TASK:
# Output the string "Hello, Mojo!" to the console.

# I AM NOT DONE

def main():
    print('Hello {}')
